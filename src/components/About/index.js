        <p>
        My name is AJ Stribling and I was born and raised in Crawfordsville, IN. By day you will see me as a Leasing Specialist in property management. By night you may see me with a camera in my hand. I am passionate about the arts and want to put that creativity into web development. Building a career in something I am passionate about is very important to me. From film and photography to coding, I will strive for greatness.
                </p>

          I am currently learning about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java, JQuery and APIs. I practice coding daily and I am excited to learn all the main concepts to become a full-stack developer.
